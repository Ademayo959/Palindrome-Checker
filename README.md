 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters a word or phrase in the input field.  
2. JavaScript processes the input by:
   - Removing spaces and special characters  
   - Converting all letters to lowercase  
   - Reversing the string  
3. It compares the original processed input to the reversed version.  
4. Displays the result to the user.
